This is my project in CS107-F21.

This repository is currently private.

Progressing in File read and write.


### ~~Task 1: Initialize Game (20 pts)~~

* ~~Your program should be able to initialize a new chess game, which includes the
chessboard and the initial disks in their correct position.~~

* ~~Your program should be able to display the status of the game (In Progress, Dark
Turn or Light Turn, etc.)~~

* ~~Your program should be able to restart a game by clicking a button rather than
closing it and open the game again.~~


### Task 2: Load and Save a Game (20 pts)
* Your program should be able to load an existing game from a text file with a predefined format by clicking buttons. After loading, all disks should be placed at
their positions given in the text file. The save file includes at least the current
chessboard, the previous moves, and the current side to play (dark or light).

* Your program should be able to perform error check, e.g., there is no winner yet,
any move is invalid, etc.

* Your program should be able to save the current game into a text file.


### ~~Task 3: Play the game (20 pts)~~
* ~~Your program should detect the winning status of the game, and end the game
when there is a winner.~~

* ~~Your program should allow disks to be flipped according to the rules.~~

* ~~During one game, your program should be able to switch between the normal
and the cheat mode, the latter of which allows a player to place either dark or
light disks at any empty position.~~


### ~~Task 4: Graphical User Interface (20 pts)~~
* ~~Your program should have a graphical user interface using Java Swing (JavaFX is
accepted.)~~


### Bonus (20/30 pts):
If your program satisfies all the above basic requirements, you will get 80 points. The
remaining 20/30 points will be given as bonus. You are highly encouraged to go
beyond our requirements. Below are some possible ways to get bonus. Compare to
the bonus points, the basic points are easier to get. Here you need to rely on your
own ability to present your programming charm!
* ~~Design Human vs. Machine mode of different difficulty level, and make the
machine player smarter.~~
* Design a platform for your game, such as adding multi-user, ranking list, adding
start menu for selecting the game modes, etc.
* Make your game looks nicer, such as change the theme, adding sound effect,
adding background music, adding more prompt label when the game is in
process.
* ~~Show possible moves when a disk is being placed.~~
* Play the process of placing and flipping disks after loading the save file.
* ~~Undo operation.~~
* Support on-line mode in Local Area Network.
* Pack the game as an executable that can be executed on a computer without JRE.
* And more.

A/B/C/D class. A grants 8 pts, B grants 4 pts,C grants 2 pts, D grants 1 pts.
