This is my project in CS107-F21.

This repository is currently private.

### Task 2: Load and Save a Game (20 pts)
* Your program should be able to load an existing game from a text file with a predefined format by clicking buttons. After loading, all disks should be placed at
their positions given in the text file. The save file includes at least the current
chessboard, the previous moves, and the current side to play (dark or light).

* Your program should be able to perform error check, e.g., there is no winner yet,
any move is invalid, etc.

* Your program should be able to save the current game into a text file.


### Bonus (20/30 pts):
If your program satisfies all the above basic requirements, you will get 80 points. The
remaining 20/30 points will be given as bonus. You are highly encouraged to go
beyond our requirements. Below are some possible ways to get bonus. Compare to
the bonus points, the basic points are easier to get. Here you need to rely on your
own ability to present your programming charm!
* Design a platform for your game, such as adding multi-user, ranking list, adding
start menu for selecting the game modes, etc.
* Make your game looks nicer, such as change the theme, adding sound effect,
adding background music, adding more prompt label when the game is in
process.
* Play the process of placing and flipping disks after loading the save file.
* Support on-line mode in Local Area Network.
* Pack the game as an executable that can be executed on a computer without JRE.
* And more.

A/B/C/D class. A grants 8 pts, B grants 4 pts,C grants 2 pts, D grants 1 pts.
